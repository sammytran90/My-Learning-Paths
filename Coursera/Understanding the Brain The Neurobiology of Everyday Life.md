And it is also true that a single function can be impaired by damage to multiple parts of the nervous system. Damage to the spinal cord could cause impairment of which of the following functions? Check all that apply.

Abstract functions
Hearing
Reading
Voluntary movement of the arms and legs
Homeostasis
